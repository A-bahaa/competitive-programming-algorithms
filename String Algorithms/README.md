## Introduction
Many string problems can be solved easily in `O(n^2)` but that brute force solution can be replaced by more efficient algorithms that work in `O(n)` or `O(n log n)` time . For example **the pattern-matching** problem can be easily solved in `O(n*m)` n : the string length , m : the pattern length , but we can reduce that time to `O(n+m)` using Rabin-Karp algorithm .
